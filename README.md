My solutions for programming practice questions on LeetCode

This repository contains my solutions for the coding problems on LeetCode. 

The algorithms problems are coded in Java as I'm more familiar with data structures in Java. I'll slowly revisit the problems trying to program in Python as well. 

In each problem, I will provide the link to the problem itself on LeetCode, my script and the metrics for runtime and memory usage. Note that my code may be suboptimal regarding to computation and storage complexity but I will try my best to optimize them. 

I included the explanations of the solutions and managed to add sufficient comments in the code for better comprehension.
